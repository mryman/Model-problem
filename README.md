Model a pre-climb safety check

Problem statement:

We are going to model a safety check, carried out by a climber and belayer prior to beginning a climb. The check uses a sequence of visual/physical equipment inspection steps and a call-and-response series of verbal communications.

The climber wears a harness, ties into a rope, inspects his own harness and knot, inspects the belayer's equipment, issues verbal calls, and waits for verbal responses before proceeding.

The belayer wears a harness, loads the rope into a belay device, connects the belay device and rope to his harness with a locking carabiner, inspects all of his equipment, inspects the climber's harness and knot, waits for verbal calls, and issues verbal responses to calls from the climber when prompted.
