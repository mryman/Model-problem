			<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
			<p class="mainP"> City Cliffs provides a unique training facility and specialized programs for youth and adults within 			our communities.
					We opened the very first rock climbing gym in America in 1987 on Elliott Ave in Seattle. The gym was no more than rocks glued to painted plywood panels. Today, with more advanced facilities, the City Cliffs can accommodate a variety of custom group climbing needs, including: birthday parties, school and church groups, corporate events, private parties, and more.
					City Cliffs currently has three partner gyms in Washington: Seattle, Redmond and Everett. Please contact your local gym to check out the facilities, classes, programs, events or to book a party or corporate event.</p>
